            The "Te escucho, te acompaño" project is based on the main objective of the Family program: to promote and implement initiatives that contribute to emotional and physical wellbeing in the family environment. Mental health is a very important part of a person's life and, although in recent years it has been given the place and importance it deserves, there is still a long way to go. Our team of psychologists will offer free counselling and support throughout the year through talks, workshop and invididual sessions with adults, children and families
